## Overview

This is a full-stack authentication app built with Next.js for both the frontend and backend. It leverages various libraries and tools to implement authentication features, including JWT, Bcrypt, and more. The app uses MongoDB as the database and integrates with Mailtrap and Nodemailer for sending verification emails.

## Features

- **Login:** Access the login page at `/login` to authenticate users.

- **Change Password:** Use the `/changepassword?token=...` route to set a new password after the reset.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** Next.js
- **Backend:** Next.js API routes
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Authentication:** JWT, Bcrypt
- **Email:** Mailtrap, Nodemailer

## Things I've Learned

- **Building a Full-Stack Application:** This project involved creating both frontend and backend components using Next.js, providing a comprehensive understanding of full-stack development.
